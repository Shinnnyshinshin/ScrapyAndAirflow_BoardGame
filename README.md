# ScrapyAndAirflow_BoardGame

This project describes an initial exploration of the potential of Apache Airflow, a workflow management system developed by Airbnb.  In a simple test case it will be used to write a ETL pipeline for extracting data from a set of webpages every hour. Scrapy, a python framework will be used to do the actual web crawling and data scraping.
